For some reason, I decided not to use maven to manage release tags. I can't remember why :P

Anyway, the way we do hadoop releases is:

1) Update all versions to the new one. If we are building 2.3.0-mmx4, this will go something like:
    for x in `find . -name pom.xml` ; do perl -pi -e 's/2.3.0-mmx3/2.3.0-mmx4/g' ; done

2) Tag the new version:
    git tag 2.3.0-mmx4

3) Push to github:
    git push --tags

4) Build and deploy to artifactory. This will make jars available for inclusion in client-side projects:
    mvn clean deploy

5) Update HADOOP_VERSION in the hadoop-mmx repository.

6) Build hadoop-mmx with jenkins. This will make a galaxy tarball available for app deployment.
