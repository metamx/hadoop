For some reason, I decided not to use maven to manage release tags. I can't remember why :P

Anyway, the way we do hadoop releases is:
NOTE: Modern way to release hadoop - use deploy.sh script

1) Update all versions to the new one. If we are building 2.7.3-mmx2, this will go something like:
    for x in `find . -name pom.xml` ; do perl -pi -e 's/2.7.3-mmx2-SNAPSHOT/2.7.3-mmx2/g' "$x" ; done
    or
    mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=2.7.3-mmx2 versions:commit

2) Push those commits:
    # add, commit
    git push

3) Tag the new version:
    git tag release-2.7.3-mmx2

4) Push to github:
    git push --tags

5) Build and deploy to artifactory. This will make jars available for inclusion in client-side projects:
    git checkout release-2.7.3-mmx2
    mvn clean
    cd hadoop-build-tools
    mvn install
    cd ../
    mvn package -Pdist,docs,src -DskipTests -Dtar
    mvn deploy -DskipTests

6) Update 'hadoop.version' in the pom.xml of the hadoop-mmx repository.

7) Build hadoop-mmx with jenkins. This will make a galaxy tarball available for app deployment.
